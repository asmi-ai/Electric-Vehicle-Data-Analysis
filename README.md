This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. The dataset contains detailed information on various electric vehicle attributes, including make, model year, electric range, and more. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from this data.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

VIN (1-10): The first 10 characters of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
County: The county in which the electric vehicle is registered.
City: The city in which the electric vehicle is registered.
State: The state in which the electric vehicle is registered.
Postal Code: The ZIP code of the vehicle's registered location.
Model Year: The year the electric vehicle was manufactured.
Make: The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan).
Model: The specific model of the electric vehicle (e.g., Tesla Model S).
Electric Vehicle Type: The type of EV (Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)).
Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Indicates whether the vehicle qualifies for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle benefits.
Electric Range: The maximum range of the vehicle in miles when fully charged.
Base MSRP: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the vehicle.
Legislative District: The legislative district where the vehicle is registered.
DOL Vehicle ID: Unique vehicle identifier from the Department of Licensing (DOL).
Vehicle Location: The vehicle's location (latitude and longitude).
Electric Utility: The name of the electric utility company serving the vehicle's location.
2020 Census Tract: The 2020 Census Tract number for the vehicleâ€™s location.

Objectives 

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:

Task 1: This is an open ended problem. Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) on the dataset available above.

Task 2: Create a Choropleth using plotly.express to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.

Task 3: Create a Racing Bar Plot to display the animation of EV Make and its count each year.
